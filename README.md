# Housing-Price-Prediction
An attempt to predict housing prices in USA
The housing dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
A number of models have been trained and tested and then the best model is selected.
A pipeline is created where preprocessing, training and testing is done with the best performing model.
Note - Due to the low size of data, we can achieve only limited performance.
The model is then saved using pickle.
